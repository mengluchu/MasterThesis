Motivation
========================================================

- DETER: identification of land cover change by visual interpretation
- 
- shift from early warning system to near real-time
- To support the visual analysis in newly captured images  
- Quickly detecting  


Research Questions
========================================================
* How to develop an automated, near real-time monitoring system for the deforestation events in Amazon's rainforest?

* How can the performance of the automated approach be validated (evaluated)?

* What are the limitations of a “near real-time” system to successfully detect deforestation and forest degradation?

* How fast can one detect a deforestation event with high accuracy/validity?
